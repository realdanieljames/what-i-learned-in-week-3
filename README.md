## FUNCTIONS
I learned about creating functions. functions as i understand it to be;  means putting something into a 'machine' and expecting a result.
- for example -> putting a coil of yarn into a "shirt maker machine" and out comes a fully made shirt.
- for example2 -> putting sea water into a machine and out comes fresh, safe-to-drink water.

What happens inside the shirt maker machine is not necessary for the user to know. the expected result is a shirt.

functions make our life easier by doing the work for us whenever we need it.


## GIT

On the topic of GIT, i learned what github was about after all these years.
Git is a program which assists developers in keeping record of any changes made to any of their code. Any changes made to a code script/scripts is recorded, timestamped and given an identification-number for easy trace back abilities; which becomes useful if anyone needs to retrace their steps and check what a code was like before any recent changes.a
